of outbreak 1 (Ma'ale Shomron) is indicated on the map at <a href="https://tinyurl.com/59kmrsyt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://tinyurl.com/59kmrsyt</a>
. It is situated 60 km (37.3 mi) south of Outbreak 2 (Kfar Yehoshua) and 8.5 km (5.3 mi) east of the old demarcation line between the 'West Bank' and Israel (lined on the map).
<br><br>The earlier outbreak, in Maale Shomeron, reportedly started 1 Feb 2022, affecting a 93-strong beef-cattle herd that grazed in an infected region, within the West Bank.
FMD O reportedly started spreading in the territory of the Palestinian Authority (within the West Bank) in mid-December 2021 or earlier (ProMED post <a href="javascript:;"
onclick="window.open('https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=20211216.8700299');">20211216.8700299</a>). The Kefar Yehoshua outbreak, involving about 800 housed fattening
calves, reportedly started 2 days later. These figures probably present 'vaccination in response to an outbreak'; the history of previous vaccination(s) is requested.
Periodic FMD vaccination of cattle, sheep, and goats is compulsory in Israel; the responsibility for the acquisition of matching vaccines and the execution of the vaccination
is borne by the State Veterinary Services.<br><br>An FMD virus, reportedly circulating in Jordan since early November 2021, has been sequenced and genotyped there as FMDV O,
 topotype ME-SA, lineage PanAsia 2, sublineage ANT-10 (ProMED post <a href="javascript:;" onclick="window.open('https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=20211229.8700556');">
 20211229.8700556</a>). The strain from the Palestinian Authority was found by the Kimron Veterinary Institute to have the same profile (ProMED post <a href="javascript:;"
  onclick="window.open('https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=20211231.8700601');">20211231.8700601</a>). Genotyping results of the virus from the 2 new outbreaks in Israel
   are not yet available, but it will surprise me if they differ from the Palestinian Authority strain. Hopefully, samples from Jordan, Palestinian Authority, and Israel
    have been submitted to an international reference laboratory for comparative studies and for vaccine matching tests.<br><br>The current event seems to involve 3
    political entities: Jordan, where the epizootic reportedly started (early November 2021), spreading to the Irbid province, adjacent to the Jordan River; the
    Palestinian Authority, where it was initially recorded (close to the Jordanian border) on 12 Dec 2021 (and spreading since); and Israel's 2 outbreaks
    (including one outbreak in a Jewish settlement in the West Bank). Collaboration in combatting infectious animal diseases, within a common ecological niche, is essential
     for the sake of the region and beyond, and in the spirit of One Health. It will require the involvement of international agencies and lots of goodwill --
     to overpower the political obstacles.<br><br>Sharing a draft with the public testifies to transparency. The draft may undergo editorial updates by OIE/WAHIS
     before its final publication/distribution as an OIE "Immediate Notification". - Mod.AS<br><br>ProMED map of Israel:
